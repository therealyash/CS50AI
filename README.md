# CS50AI

This course explores the concepts and algorithms at the foundation of modern artificial intelligence, diving into the ideas that give rise to technologies like game-playing engines, handwriting recognition, and machine translation. Through hands-on projects, students gain exposure to the theory behind graph search algorithms, classification, optimization, machine learning, large language models, and other topics in artificial intelligence as they incorporate them into their own Python programs. By courseâ€™s end, students emerge with experience in libraries for machine learning as well as knowledge of artificial intelligence principles that enable them to design intelligent systems of their own.

## Concepts of AI 
- Graph Search Algorithms: Learned how to navigate and search graphs.
- Classification: Mastered the art of categorizing data.
- Optimization: Fine-tuned algorithms for better performance.
- Machine Learning: Got hands-on with supervised and unsupervised learning.
- Large Language Models: Explored the tech behind natural language processing.
